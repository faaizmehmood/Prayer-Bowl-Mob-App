# Prayer-Bowl-Mob-App
**About** Its the App where users can sign up or sign in and create lists of people's names. They can then shake a virtual bowl to randomly select a name from the list, accompanied by a message ("Marty is praying for you"). My role involved integrating APIs and enhancing the app's design for a better user experience.
